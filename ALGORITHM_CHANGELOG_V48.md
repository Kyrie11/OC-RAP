# v48 OC-TRAC-SR Algorithm Changelog

## v48.22 — OC-TRAC-COVENANT-BRIDGE (2026-07-30)

### v48.21 result attribution

- The v48.21 dedicated controller is valid and records `pipeline_valid=true`,
  `test_roots_read=false`, and `RC=20`; Near/Contact fit and verify support are
  non-empty and feasible. This is a genuine Natural-gate rejection, not a data,
  parameter-count, unsupported-gate, or controller failure.
- v48.21 converted part of the Near signal into learned selector evidence, but only
  in one objective branch. Balanced Near reaches candidate benefit AUC 0.841 and
  learned frozen-top-k benefit AUC 0.805, with positive top-1 regret 0.005. Precision
  Near collapses to 0.201/0.339. The Near signal is therefore real but not stable
  under the current training objective.
- Contact shows the first partial evidence of transferable safe-benefit selection in
  one branch: Precision candidate/learned benefit AUC is 0.586/0.613 and learned
  top-1 correlation is 0.166. Balanced Contact remains 0.540/0.432 with correlation
  -0.165. Contact capability is not jointly present with the strongest Near model.
- Component-risk learning is retained: learned harm AUC is approximately 0.60--0.65
  in Near and 0.64--0.66 in Contact. However, harmful top-1 switch rates remain
  0.45--0.70. Global harm AUC mainly separates harmful candidates from abundant dead
  candidates and does not adequately separate harmful candidates from high-benefit
  safe candidates at the deployment frontier.
- Every main and ablation certificate still has zero verify coverage. The nearest
  Balanced-Near fit rule selects 12 groups with only 2 positives, precision LCB
  0.071 and harmful UCB 0.673. The nearest Precision-Contact rule selects 19 groups
  with 2 positives, precision LCB 0.045 and harmful UCB 0.292. This is not a small
  threshold miss.
- The frozen proposal remains non-limiting: positive top-k oracle hit is about
  0.97--1.00. Proposal retraining remains prohibited in this round.

### Root defects found in v48.21

1. **Three deployment semantics were compressed into two heads.** Raw PCD benefit,
   componentwise harm, and final safe admission are different hypotheses. v48.21
   trained its benefit head on safe benefit while the preregistered gate continued
   to measure raw benefit plus an independent harm veto. This made one logit serve
   incompatible training, reporting, and certificate meanings.
2. **The safe-opportunity MIL probability was not safe.** The noisy-OR group loss used
   only `sigmoid(opportunity)` and ignored harm, even though its target was “at least
   one raw-beneficial and non-harmful candidate”. It therefore rewarded high
   opportunity on positive-but-harmful candidates—the exact false-safe failure mode
   exposed by Contact.
3. **Benefit and harm were combined differently in loss, checkpoint selection,
   calibration, and runtime.** Group MIL, safe-set loss, soft dev metrics and
   deployment did not all consume one explicit admission score. Candidate AUC could
   improve without improving the action actually certified or executed.
4. **Sparse admission gradients still competed semantically with raw benefit.** The
   same benefit logit was expected to preserve raw opportunities and also encode the
   conjunction `benefit AND non-harm`. Balanced learned Near while Precision learned
   part of Contact, producing complementary specialization rather than one model
   that works in both regimes.
5. **The zero-initialized source identity was never evaluated as a checkpoint.**
   Training started checkpoint comparison after epoch 1. A useful source/consensus
   initialization could not win if the first update damaged one regime.
6. **Sampler semantics needed an explicit task choice.** Raw benefit and safe
   admission now have separate heads. The positive group sampler must deliberately
   oversample safe-admission groups without changing the raw-benefit target.
7. **Certificate diagnostics were incomplete at the safety frontier.** Global
   benefit/harm AUC concealed failure among high-opportunity candidates. Safe-positive
   AUC and conditional high-opportunity harm AUC are required diagnostics.
8. **New admission branch had an uncovered runtime error during development.** The
   loss accepted `pred_admission_logit` but initially failed to initialize the local
   `admission_logits` tensor. A gradient-level unit test exposed and fixed this before
   delivery; static compilation alone would not have caught it.

### v48.22 algorithm: COVENANT-BRIDGE

**COVENANT = Cross-regime Opportunity, Veto Evidence, and Non-regime-specific
Admission with Nominal-preserving Transfer.** It remains one unified model over Safe,
Near and Contact. No regime ID, bucket-selected calibrator, or regime-specific
residual is available at inference.

1. **Three factorized hypotheses.** The unified model now predicts:
   - raw recovery benefit, trained on total PCD improvement and used by the primary
     opportunity gate;
   - DRS/deployability/gap component harm, aggregated by exact non-compensatory
     maximum and used by the independent harm veto;
   - final safe admission, trained on `raw benefit AND no component veto` and used
     for top-k reranking and group admission.
2. **Detached conservative admission prior.** The admission logit starts from
   `detach(raw_benefit_logit) - softplus(detach(harm_logit))` plus a zero-initialized,
   bounded admission residual. Sparse admission gradients cannot overwrite benefit
   or risk heads, while the prior remains conservative and context-correctable.
3. **Correct safe-opportunity MIL.** Frozen-top-k noisy-OR now uses the explicit
   admission probability. In the two-head ablation it uses
   `P(raw benefit) * (1-P(harm))`; it never uses opportunity alone. Candidates
   outside frozen top-k receive no group-opportunity gradient.
4. **One deployment score everywhere.** Training safe-set loss, soft checkpoint
   metrics, calibration, evaluator, selector and closed-loop runtime all use the
   explicit candidate-vs-nominal admission score. Legacy checkpoints fall back to
   their historical opportunity-minus-harm score.
5. **Raw-benefit/safe-admission sampler decoupling.** Raw benefit remains the benefit
   head target, while `group_batch_safe_positive_target=true` stratifies minibatches
   using safe-positive groups. Harmful-benefit overlap groups still supervise raw
   benefit and harm tails, but are not presented as positive admission groups.
6. **Epoch-zero checkpoint evaluation.** The source/consensus identity is validated
   and saved before any optimizer step and may win early stopping.
7. **COVENANT checkpoint risk.** The threshold-free CONCORD risk is retained and adds
   worst-regime harmful policy mass and false-admission penalties. This is dev-only,
   uses no test root, and does not relax the Natural gate.
8. **Frontier diagnostics.** Certificate reports now include candidate safe-positive
   AUC, learned top-k safe-positive AUC, and harm AUC conditioned on high opportunity,
   separating broad risk discrimination from the safety-critical decision frontier.

### Non-repeated v48.22 ablations

1. `A_two_head_safe_probability`: raw benefit + component harm, corrected
   `P(benefit)*(1-P(harm))` group probability, no third admission head. This isolates
   the v48.21 MIL/score engineering correction.
2. `B_triad_candidate_only`: three heads and candidate admission BCE, but no group MIL
   or setwise objective. This isolates the third hypothesis.
3. `C_triad_group_mil_aggregate`: admission head plus group objectives with one
   aggregate harm tail. This isolates component risk heads.
4. `D_full_covenant`: raw benefit, three component veto heads, admission head,
   deployment-exact safe-set loss, safe-opportunity MIL and COVENANT checkpoint risk.

All eight tasks (four groups times Balanced/Precision) are launched together. Round-
robin assignment places four tasks on GPU0 and four tasks on GPU1. Each task defaults
to batch size 48, one DataLoader worker, and bounded host math threads to reduce A30,
CPU and disk contention.

### Decision and non-repetition rules

- `RC=0`: run only the authorization-checked stress command generated by the
  independent certificate, then multi-seed confirmation and final Safe paired
  non-interference evaluation using the same selected checkpoint.
- `RC=20`: do not read test. Use A/B/C/D to identify whether the missing factor is the
  admission hypothesis, group supervision, or component veto. Do not tune the gate
  or proposal.
- `RC=30`: no algorithm conclusion is allowed. Repair the named protocol, index,
  training, checkpoint or certificate stage first.
- Do not repeat safe-benefit-overloaded opportunity heads, opportunity-only MIL,
  shared two-head admission semantics, fixed-threshold early stopping, exact-min
  benefit transfer, regime-specific calibrators, raw high-dimensional context,
  proposal retraining, threshold-grid-only tuning, or dataset regeneration in this
  round.

### Local validation

- `pytest`: 209 passed, 5 warnings.
- `python -m compileall -q src tools tests`: passed.
- `bash -n` for all shell scripts: passed.
- New tests cover three-head bucket invariance/capacity, detached-gradient isolation,
  harmful-benefit MIL rejection, independent safe-positive sampling, explicit
  admission-score plumbing, epoch-zero selection, and eight-task/two-GPU assignment.
- The delivery environment has no real WOMD/Waymax data or A30 GPUs. No v48.22 gate or
  closed-loop result is claimed.
